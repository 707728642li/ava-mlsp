This is part of the code for the paper ["Effective Aesthetics Prediction with Multi-level Spatially Pooled Features"](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Hosu_Effective_Aesthetics_Prediction_With_Multi-Level_Spatially_Pooled_Features_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf)

Multi-level Spatially-Pooled (MLSP) features are used to train predictors on the AVA aesthetics database.

The code currently deals with narrow MLSP features. MLSP-trained models are included.
